## Introduction
The U-Can’t Card Game is a text-based C++ project that simulates a card game where players, represented as professors, draw and play cards to attack each other's students and prestige. The game involves different types of cards, including students and management meddling cards, each with unique abilities and effects. Players take turns drawing cards, playing them, and activating student cards to attack the enemy.

## Project Specification
This project implements the U-Can’t Card Game according to the given specifications and grading criteria. It consists of several classes to represent cards, players, and game management. The project uses C++ and leverages object-oriented programming concepts to ensure a flexible and scalable game structure.


## How to Run
To run the U-Can’t Card Game, follow these steps:

1. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
2. Run the compiled executable in your terminal or command prompt.
3. The game will start and display the welcome message along with the game output after each turn.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game and view the results.

## Game Rules
The U-Can’t Card Game is played as follows:

1. Each player, represented by a professor, starts with 30 prestige points.
2. The game lasts for 30 rounds.
3. Players take turns drawing a card from their deck, adding it to their hand, and then playing a card from their hand.
4. Students form the professor's cohort and are placed on the table after being played.
5. Students attack enemy students or the enemy professor during the activation phase.
6. Students can be defeated if their resilience is reduced to 0, causing them to leave the table.
7. The game ends when all rounds are completed or if a professor's prestige reaches 0, leading to their sacking.

## Grading Criteria
The project has been implemented following the grading criteria provided in the project specifications. The grading criteria include different levels of implementation, ranging from the bare pass to high first classification. The project's implementation covers various features such as class hierarchies, polymorphism, memory management, smart pointers, and additional card types.

Grade Achieved: <b>High First Class(84%)</b>
